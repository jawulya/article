The concept of life strategies has been widely discussed in sociology. The works of famous Ukrainian sociologists are devoted to the definition and research of life strategies. 
According to S. Babenko, there are four types of life strategies: exclusion, survival, adaptation and achievement, where the author argues that life strategies are critical for understanding how individuals navigate the opportunities and constraints of the Ukrainian economy and society. 
At the same time/ in contrast, O. Zlobina and V. Tikhonovych distinguish two types of life strategies: survival strategy and life creation strategy. The authors analyze the levels of adaptation to changes in Ukrainian society, highlighting the dichotomy of life strategies: from voluntary, successful and positive to forced adaptation. 
Some authors (S. Makeev, L. Bilyaeva and others) take another approach indicating that life strategies act as the most influential criterion for the real stratification of society.
Reznik, T. E., & Reznik, Y. M. have conducted a research on a range of topics related to life strategies. They have examined the relationship between life strategies and social inequality in post-Soviet Ukraine. They argue that life strategies are influenced by both structural and cultural factors, playing a key role in shaping individuals' experiences of social inequality. 
The given examples show that the current state of development of the concept of "life strategy" and the research of life strategies is relevant, but versatile and thus require the in-depth attention of sociologists.

Methodology:
This article is based on the analysis of data from three research studies conducted by Lviv IT Cluster, DOU and Group Reiting. All of them are quantitative in nature. The first and second studies are surveys conducted by Lviv IT Cluster and DOU, while the third study used the standardized interview technique in two forms: Computer-Assisted Telephone Interviewing (CATI) and Computer-Assisted Web Interviewing (CAWI) techniques.
More than 5,000 respondents were surveyed in the Lviv, Ivano-Frankivsk, Rivne, Ternopil, Volyn, Chernivtsi and Zakarpattia regions. Data collection and analysis within the sociological part of the IT Research Resilience project was provided by the Fama Research Agency on request from the Lviv IT Cluster. The purpose of IT Research Resilience is to comprehensively investigate the changes occurring in the tech industry of the western region of Ukraine after the beginning of the full-scale invasion, to analyze the events and the transformation of the IT industry after the victory of Ukraine.
Add amount The CATI methodology was used in the second study conducted by Group Reiting. The sample for the study was selected using random digit dialing, and the data was collected through telephone interviews. The interviews were conducted by trained interviewers who followed a standardized script and asked questions. The data collection process took place in February 2023.

Results

War caused changes in the IT industry - this is confirmed by 44% of surveyed IT specialists. Prior to February 24th, the most common changes among IT professionals were job changes or transitions to other projects. However, new trends emerged after the start of the full-scale invasion. For example, 11% of respondents reported transitioning to part-time employment, while another 11% lost their jobs and are currently searching for new ones.
The IT community actively contributes to the victory by donating to the Ukrainian Armed Forces (UAF). 89% direct their funds towards charity (donations), with 14% spending more than 25% of their income on this cause. The average monthly contribution from those who donate is $270. IT companies even surpass their employees in this regard. Thus, 96% of companies financially support the UAF, TrO, humanitarian missions, and equipment procurement. As of May 2022, 38% of companies transferred up to $20,000, 30% - from $21,000 to $50,000, 10% - from $51,000 to $100,000, 11% - from $101,000 to $300,000, and 11% more than $300,000.
The landscape of the IT market has changed due to both internal migration and emigration. For example, in western regions of Ukraine, the number of specialists has increased from 16.5% to 24%. In central regions, the number has grown from 8.4% to 22%. Southern regions have lost 3.2% (from 8.2% to 5%). The most significant changes occurred in eastern regions, where the number of IT specialists decreased from 27.8% to approximately 10% (17.8%). Northern regions have experienced almost no changes. Roughly 17-20% of IT specialists have emigrated, which is an estimated 50,000-57,000 people. These percentages are based on the total number of IT specialists in December 2021 - 285,000, and May 2022 - 228,000.
According to IT Research Resilience, among other factors that encourage IT specialists to emigrate, are hypothetical loss of housing or job in Ukraine, harsh state regulation of the economy, including taxation, freezing of the military situation, and a shortage of vacancies in Ukraine. Under such conditions, from 40% to 49% of those surveyed are ready to become IT emigrants. It is most likely that specialists with an average age of 34 who work in large companies and have a couple will try to leave the country.
There has also been a change in the emotional and psychological state. The main feelings in the summer of 2022, as at the beginning of the war in March, remain fatigue (58% of respondents) and anxiety (48%), but anxiety has moved from first to second place. 37% feel sadness.
However, there are more positive emotions: 46% of IT specialists feel hope, 38% - optimism, 25% - joy (in March - 8%), 24% - calmness (in March - 15%).
The proportion of those who feel hatred (from 46% to 26%) and anger (from 42% to 24%) has decreased.
The war has affected the education and self-development of IT specialists. The proportion of those who do not have time for professional development has almost doubled - from 11% a year ago to 20% now. Among the methods of learning, online events come to the fore (58% of respondents take online courses and trainings), while the importance of professional conferences and meetings decreases (to 14% from 22% last year), as well as professional literature (in 2022, 48% read it compared to 75% in 2021).
Therefore, summarizing the above, it can be said that the life strategies of IT professionals are similar to those of the rest of society. Selected strategies change and flow into each other. At the beginning of the war, the choice of strategies was different. Most chose the strategy of adaptation, although some chose the strategy of survival. But already by the summer of 2022, it can be said that the strategy of adaptation has grown into a strategy of achievement. This is evidenced by the fact that IT specialists actively donate, engage in self-development, and learning.
